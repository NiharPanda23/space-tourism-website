      Let’s face it; if you want to go to space, you might as well genuinely go to 
      outer space and not hover kind of on the edge of it. Well sit back, and relax 
      because we’ll give you a truly out of this world experience!

    <h3>The terminology...</h3>
    <h1>Launch vehicle</h1>
  
    <p>A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a 
      payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our 
      WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, 
      it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
    </p>
    
  
    <h3>The terminology...</h3>
    <h1>Space capsule</h1>
  
    <p>A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
      capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
      you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
      and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
    </p>
  
    <h3>The terminology...</h3>
    <h1>Spaceport</h1>
  
    <p>A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, 
      by analogy to the seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the 
      famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage 
      of the Earth’s rotation for launch.</p>
